        <h2>What is Web Development? and How does the Web works?</h2>
        <p>Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites. It involves a variety of tasks, including coding, designing, and ensuring the performance of a website or web application. Web development can be divided into three main types:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Front-end development:</b> This focuses on the user interface (UI) and the visual aspects of a website that users interact with. It involves languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
            <li><b>Back-end development:</b> This deals with the server-side of a website, including databases, server logic, and APIs. It ensures that the website functions correctly behind the scenes.</li>
            <li><b>Full-stack development:</b> This combines both front-end and back-end development, allowing developers to work on all aspects of a website.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><b>How the Web works:</b> The web operates on a client-server model. Hereâ€™s a simplified breakdown:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Clients and Servers:</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Clients are devices like your computer or smartphone that request web pages.</li>
                <li>Servers are powerful computers that store and serve web pages to clients.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Internet Connection:</b> This allows data to be sent and received between clients and servers.</li>
            <li><b>DNS (Domain Name System):</b> This acts like an address book, translating web addresses (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network.</li>
            <li><b>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):</b> This is the protocol used for transferring web pages. When you enter a URL in your browser, an HTTP request is sent to the server, which then responds with the requested web page.</li>
            <li><b>Web Browsers:</b> These are programs like Chrome or Firefox that render web pages by interpreting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.</li>
        </ol>

        <ol>
            <li><b>HTML: </b>The content and structure of the displayed page.</li>
            <li><b>CSS: </b>The styling of the displayed page and its content.</li>
